\section{Introduction}

The LEGO investment market has emerged as a profitable opportunity, with an average return of 11\% \cite{lego_market}. However, the current process for analyzing prices, trends, and data on LEGO sets needs to be more cohesive and efficient.  
To address this, \textit{Bricked Up} centralizes key information, providing interactive graphs, historical price comparisons, and tools to explore investment opportunities efficiently. This report outlines the development of the software, inspired by the Bloomberg Terminal, and its role in simplifying LEGO set investments for users.


\section{Front-End}

This project's first task is to build your application's front-end side.
This section should clearly describe the technical implementation of the work put into building the front-end:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Technically describe the use of HTML 5: which HTML tags do you use, where, and why
    \item Technically describe the use of CSS: why and how you use CSS (including interesting selectors/declarations and how it is incorporated in the application)
    \item Technically describe the use of JavaScript: why and how you use it in your application (including interesting behaviors and how they are incorporated into the application)
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Resources} Lectures 1 to 3.

\myparagraph{Length} 2 columns.

\section{Authentication and Authorization}

This project's third and final task is to incorporate authentication and authorization capabilities.
This section should clearly describe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentication: The different users of the system and how it is implemented
    \item Authorization: Summarize the access of the different users in the system and how it is implemented
    \item Role table: Include a role table associating actions over the system (you can think of them as use cases) and users that can perform these actions.
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Resources} Lecture 7.

\myparagraph{Length} 2 columns.

\section{Conclusions}

The goal of the conclusion is similar to the introduction: it summarizes the work itself and the takeaways a reader should take when reading this work. However, it can use the information presented in the work to be more specific than the introduction.

In the context of the Web Technologies course, the conclusion should clearly describe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary: summary of the work and main takeaways. Also include a class diagram of the system (the models).
    \item Future Work: interesting directions on how the presented work can evolve in the future (it may be the starting point to choose individual extension topics)
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Length} Half a column.
