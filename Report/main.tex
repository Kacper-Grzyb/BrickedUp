\section{Introduction}

The LEGO investment market has emerged as a profitable opportunity, with an average return of 11\% \cite{lego_market}. However, the current process for analyzing prices, trends, and data on LEGO sets needs to be more cohesive and efficient.  
To address this, \textit{Bricked Up} centralizes key information, providing interactive graphs, historical price comparisons, and tools to explore investment opportunities efficiently. This report outlines the development of the software, inspired by the Bloomberg Terminal, and its role in simplifying LEGO set investments for users.


\section{Front-End}

Before beginning to develop all of our views, as any respectable software engineer would do, we set out to create a prototype. 
As is industry standard, we used Figma to create our prototype, which included all the views we were planning to make and a general 
outline on how the application should look. Our intention was to use a component library both for the Figma prototype as well as 
during development, but given our unique design language it did not come to be.
Since we were building a platform akin to Bloomberg Terminal (but for lego), we inspired our views by it, by using that color palette
and a similar design language: very information dense, dark-mode only and a terminal-like view. Once the Figma prototype was developed, 
we reviewed it, and started developing the front-end.
\\

As our framework of choice ended being Laravel, we tried to adopt as many Laravel defaults as possible, which was reflected 
in the way we developed our front-end. 
As templating engine, we used blade, a simple yet effective templating engine which allows for mix-and-matching HTML with PHP, 
dividing the application into components for a greater reusability and modularity. Blade is the default templating engine in Laravel, 
which meant we did not had to spend any time setting the project up but could go right to develop the views of our web app. 
We also ended up using alpine.js \cite{alpinejs} in some parts of the application, when handling graphs or to create the scrolling bar with the prices for example, where vanilla Javascript was turning out to be too complicated
or where inline PHP simply was not enough. 

Many components were divided in reusable blade components, such as the navbar, all the elements of the dashboard, as to allow customization of such, 
the authentication components and other shared items. By making use of the components we greatly reduced repeated code, allowing us to adhere as much as possible 
to the DRY \cite{dry} principle. As an upside it also sped up development time considerably, as each team member could work on a component of the website indipendently, 
without needing to wait for pages to be complete yet. 

The HTML we produced was heavily subdivided in with various \texttt{div} elements. That allowed again for a greater modularity and enabled to easily style 
different components in our web app with CSS. Most \texttt{div} element had a class associated with them, which then we would separatily style with a CSS document. 
We did not use a premade CSS stylesheet, but wrote our own, to adhere to our unique design language. All of the CSS was kept in the default \texttt{app.css}. Given the extensive use
of \texttt{div} elements with distinct classes, no conflicts emerged between components. 
Other HTML tags that were used are the \texttt{p} to hold text, \texttt{li} and \texttt{ul} tags to create lists and \texttt{img} tags to hold images correctly. 

The appropriate use of Javascript, modern HTML and CSS together with a powerful templating engine like Blade, allowed for a visually pleasing end product,
with what we believe to be an intuitive UI and UX.

\section{Authentication and Authorization}

This project's third and final task is to incorporate authentication and authorization capabilities.
This section should clearly describe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentication: The different users of the system and how it is implemented
    \item Authorization: Summarize the access of the different users in the system and how it is implemented
    \item Role table: Include a role table associating actions over the system (you can think of them as use cases) and users that can perform these actions.
\end{itemize}
