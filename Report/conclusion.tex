\section{Conclusions}

As said in the Introduction, in our Web Technologies Project we aimed to aid the people who want to get into investing in the world of LEGO. 
Achieving this required us to build and develop a system that can track and display the prices and trends of this market and show it to the user through our intuitive UI.
We worked in PHP with the Laravel Framework, utilizing different libraries and Javascript for ease of use and a better experience. \n
The heart of the application just reads from the database and using the data it shows the bare prices of sets, some information about them and basic graphs. 
This itself wouldn't be special, but the individual extencions take it to a whole another level.


\textbf{Individual Extention Topics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphs and Alerts: Intuitive, Trading-Like Graphs and the possibility to get notified about price changes.
    \item Two-Factor Authorization: Better security for the User's profile.
    \item Web Scraper: Allowing the application to not only work with a static database, but update it when needed.
    \item Dashboard Customization: Enabling the user to create the Home Page that perfectly fits them.
    \item User Inventory and AJAX Requests: Giving the user the ability to follow their favourite sets, and upgrading the UI to be more responsive
\end{itemize}
